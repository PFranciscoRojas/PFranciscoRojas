# 👨🏻‍💻 Hello, I'm Francisco
I have a degree in system engineering and a master's in computational engineering, I started my career as a software developer seven years ago, and I learned programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, Java, and .Net.

Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills in JavaScript, and node.js although java and cloud are a priority too. 

I love board games thus I am considered a strategic and competitive person.
